VueJS Date Tools


## Best features:
### Lightweight and almost no dependencies
No dependencies other than the lightweight date-fns library! All other VueJS compatible datepickers I could find until now used JQuery, Bootstrap, and Moment JS. Vue Date Tools is the best starting point for performance in Date components.

### Subcomponents are exposed for maximum flexibility
Mix and match sub-components such as the RangeSelector or the NumberIncrement to create your own VueJS datepicker that matches your specific requirements!

### Easy to customize and style
VueJS date component libraries that present themselves as "plug and play" are in my experience quite difficult to style and customize for a specific project. You *can* use the provided Example Date Components as is, but Vue Date Tools is more intended as a toolbox for date components where the hard parts have already been solved.

###  Bi-directional components for better user experience
Users also have the option to directly edit the date in the input to update the state.

### Uses Javascript Native Date object under the hood.

## Example Components:

### VueJS DatePicker with Date and Time selection
### VueJS DatePicker with Navigation arrows
### DateRange Picker to select a duration
### DateRange Picker with a list of prepared duration suggestions
### Simple TimePicker to select a time
